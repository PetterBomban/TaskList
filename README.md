# TaskList

![Preview image](https://github.com/PetterBomban/TaskList/blob/master/img/preview.png)

A work-in-progress self-hosted note keeping system, kind of like Keep.

Keep in mind that this is a beginner project :)

## Why
Because I wanted to learn Python and Flask, as well as try out developing something with someone else.

## Who
Backend - [Petter Bomban](https://Github.com/PetterBomban)

Frontend - [Rosti Melkumyan](https://Github.com/rostimelk)

## Usage
For now, we've only tested it on Flasks local development server. In addition, we just use an SQLite database for storing users at the moment. This will be changed to a proper database later on.

Install dependencies and run the app with `python app.py`.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.6.x

* Flask 0.12

* bcrypt

* bleach
